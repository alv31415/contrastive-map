CONNECTING FROM JUPYTER REMOTELY

1) From the head node run:

sbatch jupyter_lab.sh

(this uses port 8888 to execute the notebook)

2) Repeatedly run 

cat logs/jupyter.log

until the remote server starts running 

3) Once the server starts running, you'll see that the server is running at:

http://<node_name>.inf.ed.ac.uk:8888/lab?token=<token>

4) From the local terminal, connect the head node to the GPU node:

ssh -L8888:<node_name>.inf.ed.ac.uk:8888 <student_id>@mlp.inf.ed.ac.uk

5) From the local terminal, connect to the head node:

ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 <student_id>@mlp.inf.ed.ac.uk

6) In a local browser, then just run:

http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=<token>
